# Battle City Tanks
Game Project in Processing.
Replica of the good old BattleCity Tank developed by Namco Ltd.

This project was developed for Digital Image Processing course at my university in April 2016.

INSTALLATION
------------
You may simply run this application as an executable on Windows or Linux but you have to have Java 8 installed on your system!

Or, you may run it from Processing where BattleCity_Tank is the main runnable class. 
It was developed on Processing v3. Therefore, for smooth experience you need to have Processing v3 alongside Java v8. <br />
This project requires Minim sound library: <br />
In Processing, click on Sketch < Import Library... < Add Library...,
    Then search for Minim,
    Then install!
Otherwise, you can copy the minim folder under lib directory to ~/Documents/Processing/libraries/
